## About
BattleBomb is the type of 2.5D game that I dream of finishing once I release a few more smaller projects and complete classes at university, as well as internships. Since I want to make this the best game that I can, with minigames, a full-length story, along with innovative game design. While this project may more than likely be remade from the ground up when I return to it, I still would like to contribute to this repository from time to time.
