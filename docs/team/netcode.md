# Lane: Netcode

**Mission:** get **M8 — online co-op (D54)** ready to build the moment Groundwork lands: know what
the engine already gives online play and what it lacks, lay out the real options, run M8's design
session with Michael, then write the spec and the implementation plan. You design and plan; the
Builder builds (unless the orchestrator hands you the sim).

**Owns:** `docs/team/netcode/` (research, options, drafts, spikes) · `docs/HANDOFF-M8.md` (new) ·
M8 plan files under `docs/superpowers/plans/` (new) · this file. **No writes under `Assets/`.**

**Read first (in order):** `CLAUDE.md` · `docs/team/PROTOCOL.md` · `docs/team/BOARD.md` · this file
· `docs/ROADMAP.md` §3 and §4 "M8" · `docs/DECISIONS.md` D10, D11, D42, D51, D52, D53, D54 ·
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` · `docs/HANDOFF-M7.md` close-out notes · the Groundwork plan
(`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-24-groundwork-input.md`) — it replaces the input layer M8 builds on.

## The work, in order

1. **Readiness audit** → `docs/team/netcode/readiness.md`. What D10 already bought (commands, the
   fixed step, the player registry, no singletons) and what each topology would still need. Read the
   real code: `SimulationDriver`, `PlayerRegistry`, `IPlayerCommandSource`, `PlayerCommand`,
   `CharacterActor`, `DeterministicRandom` and its streams, `PlayerInventory`'s request surface, the
   solo pause, `SaveMapper`. Name every place state lives, every source of non-determinism
   (floats, Unity physics, `Time`, iteration order), and every UI action that mutates state.
2. **Options memo** → `docs/team/netcode/options.md`. Topology (host-authoritative vs lockstep or
   rollback), transport and lobbies (Steam networking and friend invites; which Steamworks wrapper;
   whether Unity's Netcode packages fit a custom simulation or state sync is written over the
   command model), and test tooling (Multiplayer Play Mode, Steam Playtest, a dev app id). Use
   Context7 for current library docs — do not work from memory. End with a recommendation and why.
3. **The design session** → with Michael, in this session. Agenda: the questions in `ROADMAP.md`
   §4 "M8". One decision at a time, your recommendation first, plain language (he is not
   technical). Record every answer in this file. Send the orchestrator the draft `D` entries.
4. **Spec and plan** → `docs/HANDOFF-M8.md`, then an implementation plan with
   `superpowers:writing-plans`, in the style of the Groundwork plan: exact files, full code, tests
   (two players always — CLAUDE.md), gates, one `DONE` per task.

**Spikes** that need Unity (a latency test, a Steam lobby smoke test) need the sim: `LOCK REQUEST`
with the reason and a time estimate. Draft spike code under `docs/team/netcode/spike/` first.

## Waiting on

Nothing.

## Current state

Not started.

## Next steps

1. Read the list above.
2. Readiness audit.
3. Options memo.

## Answers and decisions

- 2026-09-24 (Michael): online co-op ships in Early Access (D54), chosen over Remote Play Together
  and couch-only. D11 still caps the game at two players; how couch and online mix is M8's call.

## Log

- 2026-09-24 — Lane seeded by the orchestrator.
